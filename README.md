# EventManagementSystem
Rest based web application

Learnt about:
  1. How MVC is integrated as a design pattern in a project
  2. How Spring manages beans in a project and how we can change them using various scopes like protoype, session and request
  3. How to explicitly write SQL Queries for the Respositories and map them

Problems Faced:
  1. Mapping users to the events ( learnt about the @ManyToOne and related annotations and when to use what )
  2. Getting all users only from a specific event and not from all events combined
